# HTTP API

Self-hosted local server on `127.0.0.1:8080`. All endpoints return JSON. v1 is single-user with no auth (see [`../DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md) for why).

For per-subsystem internals, see [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Conventions

- All request and response bodies are JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`).
- IDs are UUIDv4 strings.
- Timestamps are RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 (`chrono::DateTime<Utc>`).
- Errors come back as `{ "error": "<message>" }` with the appropriate HTTP status code: `400` (bad request / invalid `source_file` / malformed body), `404` (unknown card), `409` (conflict — e.g. editing a non-`Pending` card), `500` (I/O, store, or `LlmError::Config`).
- Endpoints are listed in roughly the order they'll be implemented; see each one's **Status** line.

## `GET /health` — built

Liveness probe. Used for the smoke test in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Response 200:**

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

No side effects. No internal flow.

---

## `POST /ingest` — built

Ingest **one pushed note**. The server never reads the filesystem: a feeder (the [watcher](architecture.md), a manual upload, a CLI) sends a note's vault-relative path and raw markdown, and the server parses → chunks → proposes cards → persists them as `Pending`. Synchronous in v1; one file per request keeps each request short (no whole-vault long-poll). See [llm.md](llm.md#sequential-and-synchronous-for-v1).

**Request:**

```json
{ "source_file": "linear-algebra/vectors.md", "content": "# Vectors\n\n..." }
```

`source_file` is the note's path **relative to the vault** — it becomes the card's `(source_file, source_heading)` anchor. It must be relative (no leading `/`, no `..`); absolute or traversing paths are rejected `400`.

**Response 200:**

```json
{ "chunks": 3, "proposed_cards": 5, "failed_chunks": 0, "skipped_chunks": 1 }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `chunks` | Chunks produced from this note. `0` if the note's frontmatter sets `studybuddy.exclude: true`. |
| `proposed_cards` | Cards the LLM returned across all successful chunks (saved as `Pending`). |
| `failed_chunks` | Chunks where the LLM call failed with `Transient` after retries exhausted. |
| `skipped_chunks` | Chunks the LLM declined to produce cards for (`BadInput`: refusal, context too long, malformed output). |

Best-effort over chunks: a per-chunk LLM failure doesn't abort the note. Per-chunk details (heading, error reason) go to the server log, not the response. See [llm.md](llm.md#per-chunk-handling-at-the-api-layer).

**Internal flow:**

```
POST /ingest { source_file, content }
   │
   ├─► validate source_file (relative, no `..`)  → else 400
   ├─► ingest_text(content, source_file)         → Vec<ChunkContext>  (empty if excluded)
   │
   ├─► for each chunk:
   │     match llm.propose_cards(chunk).await {
   │       Ok(cards)         → build Card{Pending, anchor, tags}; proposed_cards += cards.len()
   │       Err(Transient(_)) → failed_chunks  += 1   // log warn, continue
   │       Err(BadInput(_))  → skipped_chunks += 1   // log debug, continue
   │       Err(Config(e))    → return 500            // abort note
   │     }
   │
   ├─► store.save_pending(cards)
   └─► return counts
```

**Errors:**

- `400` — `source_file` empty, absolute, or containing `..`.
- `500` — `LlmError::Config` (broken model name, auth failure — fails identically for every chunk, so we don't keep calling), or a store write error.

**Errors come back as:** `{ "error": "source_file must be a relative path without '..': ../x.md" }`

**Status:** live and wired end-to-end (validation → `ingest_text` → LLM → `save_pending`). Nine integration tests in `tests/api.rs` cover the counts path, exclusion, each LLM-error category, and both `400` validations. The directory **walking** that used to live here now belongs to the watcher feeder (`src/watcher.rs` + `src/bin/watcher.rs`); the server keeps only `ingest_text`.

## `GET /cards/due` — built

Returns cards whose `next_due ≤ now`. Frontends use this to drive review sessions; the backend is intentionally cadence-agnostic (see DESIGN.md). Cards serialize in full (the whole stored `Card`, including `status` and `created_at`).

**Response 200:**

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "content": { "type": "qa", "front": "...", "back": "..." },
      "source_file": "linear-algebra/vectors.md",
      "source_heading": "Vectors > Dot Product",
      "tags": ["math"],
      "status": "accepted",
      "created_at": "2026-06-22T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Internal flow:**

```
GET /cards/due
   └─► store.list_due(now)                       → Vec<Card>
```

`now` is the server's `Utc::now()`. Filtered to `CardStatus::Accepted`, so a card rejected after acceptance (which may still carry a lingering state entry) doesn't resurface. `GET /cards/pending` has the same `{ "cards": [...] }` shape over `CardStatus::Pending`.

---

## `POST /reviews` — built

Record a user's review of a card. Updates SRS state and `next_due`.

**Request:**

```json
{ "card_id": "uuid", "rating": "good" }
```

Valid `rating` values: `again`, `hard`, `good`, `easy`.

**Response 200:**

```json
{ "next_due": "2026-06-23T00:00:00Z", "interval_days": 4 }
```

`404` if the card has no SRS state (never accepted, or unknown id).

**Internal flow:**

```
POST /reviews { card_id, rating }
   │
   ├─► store.load_state(card_id)                 → SchedulerState   (404 if absent)
   ├─► scheduler.on_review(state, rating, now)   → ReviewOutcome { state, next_due }
   ├─► store.save_review(card_id, rating, next_due)
   └─► store.save_state(card_id, outcome.state, outcome.next_due)
```

---

## Curation endpoints — built

The flow that turns LLM-proposed cards into reviewable ones. `accept`, `reject`, and `PATCH` return `204 No Content` on success.

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /cards/pending` | List cards in `CardStatus::Pending` for the user to review |
| `POST /cards/{id}/accept` | Move a pending card into the SRS pool (`Accepted`) |
| `POST /cards/{id}/reject` | Drop a pending card |
| `PATCH /cards/{id}` | Edit a `Pending` card's `content` (curation fix-up — see below) |

**Internal flow (accept):**

```
POST /cards/{id}/accept
   │
   ├─► store.set_status(id, Accepted)
   └─► store.save_state(id, SchedulerState::default(), now)   // seed initial SRS state; due immediately
```

**`PATCH /cards/{id}` — edit a pending card**

Content-only, and only while the card is `Pending`. This is the curation fix-up path: the LLM's proposal is close but needs a tweak before it enters the SRS pool. Without it, the user's only options are accept-as-is or reject (re-authoring by hand).

Out of scope for v1: editing **accepted** cards. That forces SRS-reset semantics (does a content change invalidate scheduling history?) and reconciliation "is this stale?" decisions that the watcher — not yet built — hasn't designed. We add it as a fast-follow once the watcher forces those choices anyway.

Not editable here: the `(source_file, source_heading)` anchor (it's the source link), `tags` (note-inherited), and `status` (moves via accept/reject).

**Request:**

```json
{ "content": { "type": "qa", "front": "...", "back": "..." } }
```

**Internal flow:**

```
PATCH /cards/{id} { content }
   │
   ├─► 409 if the card's status isn't Pending     (edits are curation-only)
   └─► store.update_content(id, content)
```

The store enforces the `Pending` guard (it reads-to-write anyway), returning `AppError::Conflict` → `409`. A missing card is `404`.

**Status:** all four endpoints are live, wired to the store (and the SM-2 scheduler for `/reviews`). Integration tests in `tests/api.rs` cover the full lifecycle (ingest → pending → accept → due → review), the PATCH edit + 409-after-accept, reject, and review-of-unknown-card → 404.

## User-managed card endpoints — planned

For manual creation/deletion of cards outside the LLM-proposed flow.

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /cards` | List all cards (filterable by tag, status) |
| `POST /cards` | Create a card manually; `source_file`/`source_heading` are optional here |
| `DELETE /cards/{id}` | Hard-delete a user-managed card. Note: cards proposed by the LLM are flagged (`Orphaned`/`Rejected`), not deleted, so this only applies to manual cards. |

---

## Reconciliation endpoints — planned

For when the watcher (not yet built) flags cards as stale or orphaned and the user wants to act on them.

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /cards/stale` | Cards whose source note changed; user decides keep/edit/regenerate |
| `GET /cards/orphaned` | Cards whose source note was deleted; user decides keep/remove |
| `POST /cards/{id}/keep` | Mark a flagged card as still-valid |

The reconciliation policy itself lives in the (future) `watcher` subsystem; these endpoints just expose the queue to the frontend.
